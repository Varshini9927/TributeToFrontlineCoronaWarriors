                    <h2>DOCTORS AND HEALTH-CARE WORKERS</h2>

                        Needless to say, doctors, nurses and people working in health-care sectors are particularly vulnerable to the highly infectious disease. In response to the global pandemic, the under-resourced doctors are facing unprecedented challenges. The list of the sleep-deprived heroes includes doctors, nurses, medical cleaners, pathologists, paramedics, ambulance drivers, and health-care administrators. In the fight against coronavirus, the brave medical army stands strong with thermometers, stethoscopes, and ventilators as their weapons. Not to forget, medical researchers are working day in and night out against all odds, hoping to find the antidote to the disease.
                        Since the coronavirus outbreak, health-care professionals have not only experienced the gratification of healing patients and saving their lives but have also lost many battles along the way. On top of that, many doctors have even sacrificed their own lives in the line of duty.
                        Every day, the selfless warriors are giving it their all in health-care settings while cutting themselves off from their families and loved ones. The sacrifice that they are making for the safety and welfare of humanity is priceless and deserves lifelong gratitude on our end. Most importantly, we must reassess the value health-care workers hold in our lives and the kind of treatment they get from us. Among the several lessons this coronavirus pandemic has been teaching us, the biggest one is to find ways to sufficiently invest in the better and more efficient medical fraternity and give medical professionals the respect, compensation and infrastructure that they truly deserve once this crisis is over. Moreover, the world needs to work towards advancement in medical research and technology. Nothing will be a greater tribute to the health-care workers than this.
                        That being said, we'd now like to highlight the heroic efforts of some courageous and inspiring doctors from across the globe who lost their lives while saving the lives of COVID-19 patients.

                        Numerous instances of highhandedness in enforcing the ongoing national lockdown have caused justifiable public anger against the police across the country in recent days. Policemen have beaten up those who violated the lockdown in many parts of the country.
                        Of all categories of frontline responders to the pandemic who are risking their health and lives, police personnel are the most critical.
                        While we rightly outrage about the violence of the police, we must also appreciate the working conditions and vulnerabilities of these personnel in a poor country as ours. all of them form the frontline in the battle against the novel coronavirus, but the police are in the frontline of the frontline.

                        In the most counties, national laws impose severe restrictions to armed forces intervention in internal affairs duting peace time, more in the security realm than in that of safety.
                        So far, police forces have been able to cope with the deterioration of the security situation, even in the most pressing situations.

                        We want to thank you for your kindness and support as we all rise to meet this challenge. Some of us are lucky enough to stay at home thanks to delivery riders, who bring our everyday essentials conveniently to our doorstep.
                       <br>
                        With home delivery being excluded from the lockdown, delivery personnel have been at the frontline to keep the city ticking. Hotels, homechefs, retail and wholesale shops, fish and meat stores, medical shops, vegetables and fruits outlets depend on the delivery staff to keep their businesses running and ensure that customer's demands are met.

                        Sanitation workers are the backbone of the waste management system, but most of them work under inhumane conditions — without safety gear and social security. With the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic showing no signs of abating, sanitation workers and manual scavengers are at an increased risk of exposure.
                        We like to thank the sanitation crews. Can you imagine the mess we’d be in if they didn’t collect our garbage during this stay-at-home season? With more people at home there is even more refuse, and although that garbage may have been exposed to Covid-19, the crews still take the risk of picking it up. So thank you all.
